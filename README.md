### Project Title
Bikesharing

### Description
In this project I created for an undacity nanodegree python code to provide information on bikesharing data for three American cities. 

Basically, the user starts the code in the command line using python bikshare.py and simply response to the questions promted. After receiving some information on the data for a specific city the user can also see the raw data if she/he is interested.
